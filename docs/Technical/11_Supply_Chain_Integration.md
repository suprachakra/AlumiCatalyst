## Supply Chain Integration
This document outlines the design and implementation of a supply chain integration module for AlumiCatalyst. This module tracks the end-to-end flow of materials—from raw material sourcing through production to distribution—providing a holistic view of the manufacturing process.

### Objectives
- **End-to-End Visibility:** Enable complete tracking of raw materials, in-process inventory, and finished goods.
- **Operational Efficiency:** Streamline procurement, production, and distribution processes.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Integrate supply chain data with production analytics for improved forecasting and resource allocation.

### Key Components
- **Data Connectors:** Develop connectors to integrate with ERP systems and supplier databases.
- **Middleware Integration:** Use Azure API Management to standardize data exchange between supply chain systems and AlumiCatalyst.
- **Real-Time Dashboards:** Create dashboards that visualize supply chain KPIs such as inventory levels, lead times, and supplier performance.
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Automated notifications for supply chain disruptions or delays.

### Implementation Details
- **API Integration:** Configure secure API endpoints for data exchange with ERP and legacy systems.
- **Data Synchronization:** Utilize Azure Data Factory to schedule and perform batch or real-time data synchronization.
- **Visualization:** Extend the dashboard to incorporate supply chain metrics alongside production and energy data.
  
### Expected Benefits
- **Holistic Process Visibility:** End-to-end tracking of material flows improves decision-making.
- **Reduced Operational Delays:** Faster identification of supply chain issues enables timely interventions.
- **Enhanced Collaboration:** Improved integration between production and supply chain teams.

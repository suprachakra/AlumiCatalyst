## QA and Test Automation

Our QA strategy for AlumiCatalyst ensures that every component of the platform is rigorously tested. This document outlines our testing approach, methodologies, and automation frameworks integrated into our CI/CD pipelines.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Validate individual functions and modules.
  - Frameworks: PyTest (Python), Jest (JavaScript).
  - Target: â‰¥90% code coverage.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Test interactions between microservices and external integrations.
  - Validate data flow and API communication.
- **Performance Testing:**  
  - Use tools like JMeter and Azure Load Testing.
  - Ensure API response times are under 200 ms for 95% of requests.
- **Security Testing:**  
  - Regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing.
  - Ensure encryption, authentication, and access control are robust.
- **Regression Testing:**  
  - Automated regression tests run on every build.
  - Prevent reintroduction of previous bugs.

### Test Automation Framework
- **Organization:**  
  - Unit tests are located in `/tests/unit`.
  - Integration tests are located in `/tests/integration`.
- **CI/CD Integration:**  
  - Automated test suites are triggered in Azure DevOps pipelines.
  - Test reports are generated and reviewed weekly.
- **Monitoring & Reporting:**  
  - Real-time alerts are set up for test failures.
  - Dashboards provide insights into code quality and test coverage.

### Incident and Regression Management
- **Rollback Procedures:** Automated rollback in case of critical test failures.
- **Continuous Feedback:** Iterative improvements based on test results.
- **Collaboration:** Regular meetings between QA and development teams to address issues.

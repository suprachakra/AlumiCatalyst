## Testing Strategy
Our comprehensive testing strategy encompasses automated testing across multiple layers to ensure the quality, performance, and security of the AlumiCatalyst platform.

## Test Types
- **Unit Testing:**  
  - Validate individual modules using frameworks such as PyTest (Python) and Jest (JavaScript).
  - Target â‰¥90% code coverage.
- **Integration Testing:**  
  - Verify interactions between microservices and external APIs.
- **Performance Testing:**  
  - Utilize tools like JMeter and Azure Load Testing to ensure API response times remain under 200 ms.
- **Security Testing:**  
  - Regular vulnerability assessments and penetration tests are performed.
- **Regression Testing:**  
  - Automated regression tests run on every code commit via CI/CD pipelines.

## Test Automation Framework
- Tests are organized under `/tests/unit` and `/tests/integration`.
- Continuous testing is integrated into the Azure DevOps pipeline.
- Detailed test reports are generated and reviewed weekly.

## Incident and Regression Management
- Automated alerts trigger upon test failures.
- Rollback procedures are in place for critical issues.
- Regular review meetings ensure that test cases evolve alongside new features.

## Finance, Cost & Budgeting
This document outlines the financial framework for AlumiCatalyst, including CAPEX/OpEx estimates, ROI analysis, and budgeting for both initial deployment and ongoing operations.

### Cost Breakdown

#### Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)
- **Hardware & Sensors:** Procurement of IoT sensors and installation costs.
- **Infrastructure Setup:** Initial configuration costs for Azure services (IoT Hub, AKS, Data Lake).
- **Development Costs:** Software development, integration, and customization efforts.

#### Operational Expenditure (OpEx)
- **Cloud Services:** Recurring Azure subscriptions for compute, storage, and networking.
- **Maintenance & Support:** Ongoing costs for system maintenance, security audits, and technical support.
- **Training & Change Management:** Costs associated with user training, onboarding, and continuous improvement initiatives.

### ROI Analysis
- **Cost Savings:** Reduced scrap loss and energy consumption lead to significant annual savings.
- **Efficiency Gains:** Improved operational efficiency boosts EBITDA by an estimated 10%.
- **Revenue Opportunities:** Carbon credit mechanisms and enhanced production yield generate additional revenue.
- **Break-Even Analysis:** Estimated time to break-even based on pilot data and scaling projections.

### Financial Projections
- **Year 1:** Pilot deployment costs vs. early operational savings.
- **Year 2:** Scaling costs balanced with increased efficiency and revenue from global rollout.

### Budgeting
- **Initial Investment:** Detailed budget for CAPEX and first-year OpEx.
- **Ongoing Expenses:** Monthly and annual projections for maintenance, cloud services, and support.
- **Contingency Funds:** Allocations for unforeseen costs, integration issues, and performance optimizations.

### Assumptions & Sensitivity Analysis
- Key assumptions regarding sensor accuracy, energy cost reductions, and production yield improvements.
- Sensitivity analysis to evaluate ROI under different scenarios.

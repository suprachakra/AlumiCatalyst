## Predictive Maintenance and Energy Optimization
This document details the extension of the analytics module to include predictive maintenance features and energy optimization analytics. These enhancements aim to forecast equipment failures and optimize energy consumptionâ€”reducing downtime and operational costs.

### Objectives
- **Predict Equipment Failures:** Leverage machine learning to predict when machinery is likely to fail, enabling proactive maintenance.
- **Optimize Energy Consumption:** Analyze production processes and energy use to identify inefficiencies and recommend operational adjustments.

### Key Components
- **Data Collection:**  
  - Integration of additional sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration, motor current) to monitor equipment health.
- **Predictive Models:**  
  - Develop and train models specifically for predictive maintenance using historical equipment performance data.
  - Extend existing predictive models to incorporate energy usage metrics.
- **Alerts and Notifications:**  
  - Automated alerts when the model predicts an imminent failure or energy inefficiency.
- **Dashboard Integration:**  
  - Enhance the dashboard to display maintenance predictions and energy optimization recommendations in real time.

### Implementation Details
- **Model Development:**  
  - Use Azure Machine Learning to build a multi-output model that forecasts both equipment failure probability and energy consumption trends.
  - Train the model on historical sensor data and energy usage logs.
- **Data Pipeline Enhancements:**  
  - Update the preprocessing pipeline to include new sensor data.
  - Store additional parameters in Azure Data Lake for model training and continuous improvement.
- **Operational Integration:**  
  - Integrate predictive alerts into the incident response system.
  - Provide maintenance scheduling recommendations to operations teams.

## Expected Benefits
- **Reduced Downtime:** Proactive maintenance minimizes unplanned outages.
- **Cost Savings:** Optimized energy usage and reduced equipment failure costs improve profitability.
- **Increased Operational Efficiency:** Real-time insights lead to more efficient resource allocation.

## Performance and Stress Testing

### Overview
This document outlines procedures for performance and stress testing to ensure AlumiCatalyst can handle peak loads and scale effectively.

### Objectives
- **Stress Testing:**  
  Evaluate system performance under extreme load conditions.
- **Performance Tuning:**  
  Optimize resource allocation and system parameters.
- **Scalability Validation:**  
  Ensure the system scales horizontally during peak production.

### Key Components
- **Testing Tools:**  
  Use JMeter and Azure Load Testing for performance evaluation.
- **Test Scenarios:**  
  Simulate peak sensor data loads and high user concurrency.
- **Metrics & Benchmarks:**  
  Monitor response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
- **Optimization Cycle:**  
  Adjust system configurations based on test results.

### Implementation Details
- **Test Environment:**  
  Replicate production conditions in a controlled environment.
- **Automation:**  
  Integrate stress tests into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous performance validation.
- **Documentation:**  
  Record test results and update system configurations accordingly.

### Expected Benefits
- **Reliability:**  
  Identify and resolve bottlenecks before full-scale deployment.
- **Scalability:**  
  Confirm that the platform can handle increased load.
- **Continuous Improvement:**  
  Use metrics to drive ongoing system optimizations.

## Incident Response
This document details the incident response plan for AlumiCatalyst, outlining procedures for incident identification, classification, resolution, and communication. It includes fallback mechanisms to ensure continuous operation even during critical failures.

### Incident Response Framework

#### 1. Identification
- **Automated Alerts:** Monitored via Azure Monitor and Application Insights.
- **Manual Reporting:** Users can report issues through the support portal or designated communication channels.

#### 2. Classification
- **Severity Levels:** Critical, High, Medium, Low.
- **Impact Assessment:** Based on system downtime, data loss, or security breach.

#### 3. Response Procedures
- **Critical Incidents:**  
  - Immediate rollback to a stable version.
  - Incident Response Team (IRT) activated within minutes.
- **High Incidents:**  
  - Rapid resolution with detailed incident logs; corrective actions within 2 hours.
- **Medium/Low Incidents:**  
  - Addressed during scheduled maintenance windows.
  - Documented for trend analysis and future prevention.

#### 4. Communication Plan
- **Notifications:** Automated notifications via email, SMS, and internal dashboards.
- **Status Updates:** Regular updates until resolution.
- **Post-Incident Reviews:**  
  - Root cause analysis and lessons learned sessions.
  - Update incident response procedures based on feedback.

#### 5. Fallback Mechanisms
- **Redundancy:** Failover clusters and redundant systems to maintain high availability.
- **Manual Processes:** Activated if automated incident response fails.
- **Escalation Matrix:** Clear hierarchy for escalating unresolved incidents.

### Key Metrics
- Incident detection and response time.
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR).
- Reduction in recurring incidents.

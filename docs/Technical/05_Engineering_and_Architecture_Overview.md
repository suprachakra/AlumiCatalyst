# Engineering and Architecture Overview

## System Architecture
AlumiCatalyst is structured as a set of loosely coupled microservices deployed on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This design enables independent scaling, agile development, and rapid deployment.

## Core Modules
- **IoT Module:**  
  - Captures sensor data and manages preprocessing workflows.
- **Analytics Module:**  
  - Hosts machine learning models and delivers predictive analytics.
- **Blockchain Module:**  
  - Provides immutable logging and traceability through smart contracts.
- **Dashboard Module:**  
  - Offers a real-time, customizable user interface.
- **Integration Module:**  
  - Facilitates secure and seamless communication with ERP and legacy systems.

## Technical Stack
- **Compute:**  
  - Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Azure Functions.
- **Data Storage:**  
  - Azure IoT Hub, Azure Data Lake, Azure SQL Database.
- **Analytics:**  
  - Azure Machine Learning, Azure Synapse Analytics.
- **Security:**  
  - Azure Active Directory, Azure Key Vault.
- **DevOps:**  
  - Managed via Azure DevOps; deployments are automated using Helm charts.

## Integration and Communication
- RESTful APIs ensure clear communication between modules.
- Azure Service Bus supports asynchronous messaging.
- Centralized logging and monitoring are achieved with Azure Monitor and Application Insights.

## Scalability and Reliability
- Horizontal scaling with AKS supports high load.
- Redundancy and failover strategies maintain 99.99% uptime.
- Continuous integration and automated testing minimize downtime.

## Simulation-Based Training
Simulation-based training is designed to provide hands-on, interactive experiences that help users familiarize themselves with the AlumiCatalyst platform. This approach is critical for ensuring that staff can confidently handle real-world scenarios without the risk of disrupting operations.

### Objectives
- **Practical Skill Development:** Enable users to learn by doing in a risk-free environment.
- **Immediate Feedback:** Provide real-time guidance and corrections during simulated tasks.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Use simulation results to identify training gaps and update materials.

### Training Modules
1. **Basic Navigation Simulation:**
   - Interactive walkthroughs of the dashboard.
   - Simulated tasks for setting up alerts and viewing real-time data.
2. **Predictive Analytics Simulation:**
   - Hands-on exercises on interpreting predictive outputs and “what-if” scenarios.
   - Simulation of model retraining based on live data feedback.
3. **Blockchain & Compliance Simulation:**
   - Simulated logging of production events on the blockchain.
   - Exercises on verifying carbon credits and compliance reporting.
4. **Integration Simulation:**
   - Simulated ERP integration tasks, including data synchronization.
   - Troubleshooting exercises with realistic error scenarios.

### Implementation Details
- **Platform:**  
  - Incorporate an interactive simulation module within the dashboard.
  - Develop training scenarios using sample data and guided instructions.
- **Feedback Mechanism:**  
  - Provide immediate feedback during simulation exercises.
  - Capture performance metrics for ongoing training improvements.

### Success Metrics

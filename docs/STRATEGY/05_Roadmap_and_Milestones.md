# Roadmap and Milestones

## Overview
The AlumiCatalyst roadmap is designed to deliver incremental value over three phases—from initial MVP to full-scale global deployment. Each phase is defined by clear milestones, measurable KPIs, and feedback loops for continuous improvement.

## Phase 1: MVP Development (0–6 Months)
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - IoT sensor deployment on pilot production lines.
  - Basic data ingestion and pre‑processing pipelines.
  - Initial AI models for scrap and emissions forecasting.
  - A foundational dashboard for real‑time monitoring.
  - Proof‑of‑concept blockchain ledger for traceability.
- **Milestones:**
  - **Month 1–2:** Setup and configuration of IoT devices and Azure Data services.
  - **Month 3–4:** Development and validation of predictive models.
  - **Month 5:** Dashboard and API integration.
  - **Month 6:** Pilot testing and feedback collection.
- **KPIs:**
  - < 5-second data latency.
  - ≥85% prediction accuracy.
  - Initial reduction in scrap loss by 5–7%.

## Phase 2: Integration & Expansion (6–12 Months)
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Enhanced analytics with “what‑if” simulations.
  - Expanded sensor network across additional production sites.
  - Full blockchain integration for audit and compliance.
  - ERP and legacy system integration via secure APIs.
- **Milestones:**
  - **Month 7–8:** Refine predictive models and expand sensor coverage.
  - **Month 9–10:** Integrate ERP systems and enhance blockchain capabilities.
  - **Month 11–12:** Full system integration and performance optimization.
- **KPIs:**
  - Achieve a 10% reduction in scrap loss.
  - Demonstrable 5–8% energy savings.
  - Successful integration with at least 3 ERP systems.

## Phase 3: Global Rollout and Optimization (12+ Months)
- **Key Deliverables:**
  - Continuous model improvement using live data feedback.
  - Full enterprise-wide deployment leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
  - Advanced monitoring and automated incident response.
- **Milestones:**
  - **Month 13–18:** Enterprise rollout and user adoption.
  - **Month 19–24:** System optimization and continuous improvement.
- **KPIs:**
  - Maintain 99.99% uptime.
  - Achieve targeted EBITDA improvements.
  - User satisfaction ≥90%.

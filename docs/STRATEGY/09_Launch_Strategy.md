## Launch Strategy & Runbook

### Launch Strategy Overview
The launch strategy is designed to minimize disruption to ongoing BAU while transitioning to the new AlumiCatalyst platform. It is broken into three major phases—Pilot, Expansion, and Global Rollout—with detailed runbooks, fallback plans, and rigorous communication protocols.

#### Expansion Phase (6–12 Months)
- **Objectives:** Scale deployment, integrate ERP/legacy systems, and optimize system performance.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Expand sensor network; integrate ERP via API gateway; enhance dashboard for multi-site data.
  - Perform load testing; refine AI models; conduct extended training.

| Extended Training & Support        | T8-T10 Months   | Training          | Global training completion ≥90%           | Inadequate training uptake | Additional sessions; dedicated support.       |

- **Success Metrics:** 95% data sync accuracy; multi-site dashboard functionality; energy savings 5–8%.
- **Deliverables:** Expanded sensor network; ERP integration; updated dashboard; compliance reports.

#### Global Rollout Phase (12+ Months)
- **Objectives:** Achieve full-scale enterprise deployment with continuous monitoring and rapid iteration.
- **Key Activities:**
  - Deploy platform globally in phased waves; implement advanced monitoring and automated incident response.
  - Execute comprehensive global training; run post-launch optimization cycles.

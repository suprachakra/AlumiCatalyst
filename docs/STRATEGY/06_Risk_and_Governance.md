| Integration            | Data inconsistency between modules                        | High    | Standardize APIs; enforce automated integration tests.        |
| Performance            | Latency or throughput falling below SLA thresholds         | Medium  | Optimize code; leverage Azure scaling and caching strategies.  |
| Security               | Data breaches or unauthorized access                      | High    | Enforce encryption, RBAC, and perform regular security audits. |
